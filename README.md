# IVR-App
## Created using Node.js, javascript and some xml, this enables users to call a number and get some desired reply on DTMF tones

## How To Run :-

1) First, from the terminal run "npm install"
2) Run this files on a local server or online server (even better)
3) If local server is used use "ngrok" to run the local server online making it publicly available.
4) Get the online server link and create a account in kookoo.in and paste this url link in the voice url box
5) Now call on the number provided by kookoo.in using your pin number
6) That's all, see the app running yourself

## What It Will Do :-

1) When the user calls the number, it will ask them if they are male(1) or female(2)
2) If the user chooses male, then it will ask them if they are above 21(1), or below(2). For
females it will ask them if they are above 18(1) or below(2)
3) If the user chooses 1 above, it gives the message - "You are an adult", else it will give the 
message "Minors are not allowed".
4) End the call
